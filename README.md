This project aims to write a massively collaborative novel, one sentence at a time. Here are the <b>rules<b> (subject to change):

1. Want to add the next sentence? Send a pull request with your added sentence to this repository. If you'd like to be attributed by your real name, submit that real name with the pull request.
2. If someone's already sent a pull request, that doesn't mean you shouldn't send one! If there's "competition" for what the next sentence could be, then I'll choose which one to add.
3. No consecutive sentences can be written by the same individual. Please do not make additional GitHub accounts to subvert this.
4. Don't be racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc.. While it is possible that this novel might address social issues like racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc., I do not want this work to be a glorification or endorsement of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc..
5. Have fun!

Thank you very much for your creative and original contributions!
